Developer's Corner
==================

This is the github site of www.devcorn.de (Developer's corner). I am Ingo A. Kubbilun (mailto:ingo@kubbilun.de), a German Principal Developer (employed by a security IT company).
From time to time, you will find new projects here, which I perform privately on a **not-for-profit** base.

I have a German diploma in Computer Science now working since more than twenty years in the German IT industry. Starting in 1986, I wrote several publications for German IT magazines. The last one was in 2003 for the German Linux magazine (was translated and re-published in the English Linux magazine).

My main interests cover MS Windows as well as Linux (userland and kernel) and Android. I write my stuff in the vast majority in Java and C/C++.
